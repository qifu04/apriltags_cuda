# Camera Locations
I have no clue how you want this, but my code works and assumes files like cam-tr-offset.json to be passed as arguments into the ws_server. The location types are tl tr bl br that will be passed through. If one isn't found, it will go to cam-home-offset.json. Make the json files how you want, I have no clue what you need.
