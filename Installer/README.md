# AprilTags Installer

## NOTES
As of recent (this update), there is no longer a webserver being served by python. To update versions, MAKE SURE TO UNINSTALL THEN REINSTALL (you do not need to use any parameters with this uninstall) OR run the installer again WITHOUT PRESERVE (being -p).
This also just recently got moved out of the repo it came from. That repo is now no longer in use.
